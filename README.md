# Linkedin Trend Analysis with Python
Python was used to perform an analysis on a popular Linkedin trend - Social Saturday.</br>
The trend was showing an increasing decline and some members of the community had attributed it to some foul play by Linkedin administrators.</br>
To this end, a time-series analysis was performed to study the historical performance for a period of 6 months.</br>
The summary of the findings and recommendations are contained in these report.</br>
I believe that the result of this analysis can help both Linkedin and non-Linkedin community builders build long-lasting communities.</br>
You can either choose to view the Jupyter Notebook version or the rendered PDF version.</br>
