# Linkedin Trend Analysis with Python
Python was used to perform an analysis on a popular Linkedin trend - Social Saturday.</br>
The trend was showing an increasing decline and some members of the community had attributed it to some foul play by Linkedin administrators.</br>
To this end, a time-series analysis was performed to study the historical performance for a period of 6 months.</br>
The summary of the findings and recommendations are contained in these report.</br>
The result of this analysis and recommendations can help Linkedin community builders and members understand the behaviour of trends and communities, in order to get the best out of them towards growing their network.
It can also help both Linkedin and non-Linkedin community builders build long-lasting communities.</br>
You can either choose to view the Jupyter Notebook version or the rendered PDF version.</br>
